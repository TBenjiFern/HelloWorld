# Overview

This project is intended to be used as a starting point, a milestone, to practice the incorporation of multiple programming components into a single github repository. In this case, we are including the staple "Hello World" Python file, README.md, Git, and Github together to model what future projects may look like.
<br/>
To futher clarify, the hello.py file will print "Hello World" when run. (For window users type "py hello.py" into terminal. Mac users will use "python3 hello.py")
